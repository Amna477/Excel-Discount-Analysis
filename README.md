**Customer Discount Approval Scenario Analysis**
## 📌 Overview  
This Excel project evaluates whether a *12.5% discount* for a customer ("Croma") meets the *$100,000 Gross Margin (GM) target* under three scenarios: Best Case, Realistic, and Worst Case. It demonstrates how discounts impact profitability and the importance of scenario planning in business decisions.

## 🛠️ Key Features  
- *Scenario Analysis*: Compares outcomes for Best Case ($100k sales), Realistic ($50k), and Worst Case ($30k).  
- *Financial Metrics*: Calculates Post-Discount Sales, COGS, Net Sales, and Gross Margin.  
- *Target Comparison*: Highlights gaps between actual GM and the $100k target.  

## 📊 Parameters  
- *Discount*: 12.5%  
- *COGS Rate*: 32%  
- *Avg NIP*: 55.65 (used to derive Net Sales)  
- *GM Target*: $100,000  

## 🔍 Insights  
- *Best Case: Exceeds target by *$236,175** (due to high sales volume).  
- *Realistic Case: Falls short by *$68,087.50**.  
- *Worst Case: Barely meets target with a *$852.50 surplus** (likely due to lower COGS).  

## 📚 Learning Outcomes  
1. *Formulas*: Practiced calculations for discounts, COGS, and margins.  
   - Example: Post Discount = Net Invoice Sales × (1 - Discount)  
2. *Scenario Planning*: Learned to model financial outcomes under varying assumptions.  
3. *Data Visualization*: Organized outputs in tables for clarity.  

## 🧩 Challenges & Improvements  
- **Assumptions**: Initially miscalculated Net Sales due to unclear Avg NIP usage (revised after feedback).  
-** Next Steps**: Add dynamic variables (e.g., adjustable discount rates) and sensitivity analysis.
